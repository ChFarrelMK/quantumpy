# quantumpy

Basic quantum computing concepts implemented in Python.

Initially based on Michael Nielsen's wonderful talk at the Singularity Summit 2009.

Currently implements Ï€/8 gate, controlled-not gate and Hadamard gate.

I may have made huge mistakes, so please let me know if you spot anything wrong.

NOTE: this is a classical simulation of a quantum system and so n qubits requires
2 ^ n complex numbers with each operation affecting every one of those complex
numbers.
